Oyo Hotel bookings in Excel, I  start by gathering the data i need. This may include information like booking dates, hotel locations, prices, and customer ratings, arrival time, cancel booking, how many adults and children and guest type  . Once I  have the data then use Excel's functions and tools to perform various analyses. Some common analyses such as  calculating average prices, analyzing booking trends over time, identifying cancel booking ratio , hotel locations, and comparing customer ratings.  Dashboards are a fantastic way to present data visually and make it easier to understand. i sum up whole project in three steps which are :
ETL(Extract transform and load)
Using data to create Pivot table of hug amount of data.
sum up in third step create dashboard using Advanced skills Such as bar chart,pie chart etc.
